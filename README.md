## About This Project
Marketplaces have become essential platforms for e-commerce transactions, where product reputation is heavily influenced by customer reviews. This study aims to enhance sentiment analysis of product reviews for "kemeja pria" on Bukalapak using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The review data underwent pre-processing steps such as cleaning, case folding, normalization, tokenizing, stopword removal, and stemming to refine the language and clarify the meaning of comments. The developed model, which uses a Lexicon-Based approach with the InSet Lexicon and Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes, performed better than RapidMiner, achieving a precision of 94%, a recall of 99% for positive sentiments, and an accuracy between 91% and 94%. However, the recall for neutral reviews was recorded at 0% due to dataset imbalance, indicating a potential overfitting issue. In comparison, RapidMiner only achieved a maximum precision of 17.70%, a recall of 50%, and an accuracy between 39.04% and 44.57%. Further analysis revealed that positive reviews generally highlighted product quality, fast shipping, and customer satisfaction, while negative reviews were mostly about defective products and incorrect sizing. These findings provide guidance for sellers to improve product quality and services based on customer reviews.
